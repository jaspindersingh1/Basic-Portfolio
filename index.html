                    Welcome to my personal website! Here, you will learn a great deal about myself and my journey
                    through web development. As you can infer, this is my first website and it is developed from
                    scratch. I intend to make this website as enjoyable as possible by including various styles 
                    and formats.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In one week, I have learned how to use git, github, gitlab, and gitbash. Admittedly, I feel 
                    like a hacker using gitbash to run commands. Finally, I have command over my computer!
                    I have thoroughly enjoyed learning new material through this program and continue to look
                    forward to following classes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Please share your feedback about my website so, I can become a better developer.  I prefer to learn 
                    through trial and error because I have found that is the best way for me to learn and test my knowledge.
                    All types of criticism are welcomed.
                </p>
